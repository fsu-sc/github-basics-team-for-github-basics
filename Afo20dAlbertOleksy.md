While I do have some basic github experience, 
so I already knew about push and pull request and cloning, I learned some new terms such as what forking means and how issues can 
be used when collaborating with others. The training made me think about how I would use github features to communicate with other 
collaborators on repositories/projects. It's nice to know I can make a branch to work on edits without affecting the main branch. 
It's also very relieving that previous versions of the repository are accessible through Github.

I'm not sure when a fork would be useful as opposed to pulling a repository, 
because if I make edits, I don't need to commit them and push them to the Github repository anyways; 
I could just save those changes to my local environment. However, there is nothing else that I am currently confused about,
though I'm sure I will encounter something at some point
